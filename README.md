## My Little Phony
   - Simple Phonebook Webpage where a user can add a new item to the list of currently registered names in the phonebook
   - Combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript

### Features:
   * Add a new name in the phonybook
   * Element sizes are responsive to the screen size
   		> viewport width (vw) was used
   * The text boxes are used for input
   		> Textboxes are empty upon refresh/load
         > All textboxes should be filled before clicking the "Add Friend" button
   		> Clicking the "Add Friend" button will add the input to the list of names in the phonybook	
         > Newly added items will be displayed in the "View Friend Details"	
   * "P" tag was used in displaying the names listed in the phonybook
         > 3 Items in the list are preloaded
         > Initial list of names and their details are hidden using CSS
         > A user can navigate on the list of names using the available buttons below the page
         > querySelector() was used together with "nth-child" to navigate through the lists 
   * Items in the list cannot be deleted
   * Some Alerts/Prompts
   		> There is/are empty field
   		> Delete button was clicked
   		> Last page/item is reached
         > First page/first item is reached
         > An item was successfully added to the list

### For Further Improvements:
   * List of items can be initialized as empty
   * Add restriction to the number field by specifying the correct format to use
   * Add more input fields/information to ask from the user
   * Designs can be further improved using Bootstrap
   * Character limits can be added to the input and output
   * Codes for HTML, CSS, and JS can be separated into different files to make the JS and CSS files useful to other HTML files, especially the JS functions
